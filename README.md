# Home Station for Data Collection 💾

I plan to build a **home station** that **will collect information** from various sensors, such as temperature, humidity, air quality, and more. The goal of this project is to **monitor** different environmental parameters and provide real-time user insights.

## Features

- Collecting data from various sensors.
- Displaying real-time data.
- Data export and analysis options.

## Technologies

- **Arduino** for data collection.
- **Python** for data processing and display.
- **Graphical interface** for visualization.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/home-station.git
